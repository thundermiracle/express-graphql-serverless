# express-graphql-serverless

A simple serverless example by using express & graphQL in `netlify` functions.

As every request will trigger the restarting of express server, it's better not to use in production.

## Install

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn
```

## Develop

```shell
npm run dev
#or
yarn dev
```
